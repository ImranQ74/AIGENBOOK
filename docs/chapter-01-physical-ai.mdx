# Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence and embodied systems—robots, autonomous vehicles, and physical devices that interact with the real world. Unlike purely software-based AI, Physical AI must reason about physical constraints, dynamics, and real-time sensory input.

## 1.1 What is Physical AI?

Physical AI is AI that can perceive, reason about, and act in the physical world. It combines:

- **Perception**: Processing sensor data (vision, lidar, tactile)
- **Reasoning**: Understanding scenes, predicting outcomes
- **Action**: Controlling physical systems to achieve goals

```
Physical AI = Perception + Reasoning + Action + Physical Embodiment
```

## 1.2 Key Characteristics

### Embodied Intelligence
Unlike LLMs that exist purely in digital space, Physical AI is bound to a physical body. This creates unique challenges:

| Characteristic | Software AI | Physical AI |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Feedback Loop | Optional | Essential |
| Real-time | Not critical | Critical |
| Safety | Low stakes | High stakes |
| Sensor Noise | Absent | Present |
| Physics | Abstracted | Fundamental |

### Closed-Loop Systems
Physical AI operates in feedback loops:
1. **Sense**: Collect sensor data
2. **Process**: Interpret the environment
3. **Plan**: Decide on actions
4. **Act**: Execute physical movements
5. **Observe**: Measure outcomes → repeat

## 1.3 Applications

- **Manufacturing**: Pick-and-place robots, assembly automation
- **Healthcare**: Surgical robots, rehabilitation devices
- **Service**: Delivery robots, hospitality assistants
- **Exploration**: Space rovers, underwater vehicles
- **Agriculture**: Harvesting robots, crop monitoring

## 1.4 Challenges

### Perception Under Uncertainty
Real-world perception is noisy:
```
Noisy Sensor → Filtering → State Estimation → Action
               (Kalman/Particle)
```

### Real-Time Constraints
Physical systems cannot wait:
- **Hard Real-Time**: Must respond within deadline (safety-critical)
- **Soft Real-Time**: Degraded performance if delayed

### Safety and Reliability
Physical AI failures can cause harm:
- Fail-safe designs
- Extensive testing
- Regulatory compliance
